career-profile:
    title: Summary
    summary: |
      Since beginning his work in DevOps and cloud technologies, Jonathan has built
      a set of varied skills centered around automation and “everything-as-code”.
      He has often been called upon to design, implement, and support cloud-based
      architectures while also developing delivery pipelines for the code that runs
      on that infrastructure. Jonathan’s strengths lie in a thorough knowledge of cloud architecture,
      an understanding of development, testing, and deployment strategies for containerized
      microservices, his experience codifying infrastructure, and his 
      ingenuity in enabling application migrations to various cloud platforms. He is
      most in his element when closely collaborating with a small, dedicated team of
      developers and engineers while helping to ensure best practices for infrastructure-as-code,
      configuration management, and version control.
