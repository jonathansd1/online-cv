experience:
    - role: Cloud Solutions Architect
      time: 2015 - Present
      company: RightBrain Networks - Ann Arbor, MI
      details: |
        I am often the first technical resource made available to a new or potential client,
        and as a result get to interface with people at all levels of an organization –
        executives, project managers, developers & engineers – and speak to both the
        business objectives & the more technical issues and goals. As the subject matter
        expert, I examine a client’s criteria, design the appropriate enterprise-level solution,
        and then lead a small, dedicated team in implementation.

    - role: Storage Technician, Message Archiver & Backup Service
      time: 2013 - 2015
      company: Barracuda Networks - Ann Arbor, MI
      details: |
        I was the first-line technical resource for customers who require assistance. This
        meant managing multiple cases in different stages of progress, ranging from initial
        installations & simple configuration tasks to multi-platform deployments & device-to-
        device data migrations. All assistance was rendered remotely via SSH and remote
        sessions and would often include interfacing with multiple team members.
