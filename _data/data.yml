experience:
    - role: Senior DevOps Engineer
      time: Apr 2020 - Jun 2020
      company: Katerra - Ann Arbor, MI
      details: |
        Katerra Apollo is a software platform and suite of applications designed to support
        building projects and teams from beginning to end. In this role, I was responsible for
        designing and implementing enterprise infrastructure, platforms, and end user
        applications for cloud computing environments while securely integrating them with
        current applications.

    - role: Autonomous Cloud Architect
      time: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020
      company: Dynatrace - Detroit, MI
      details: |
        The Autonomous Cloud is the transformation of IT from manual operations to autonomous,
        NoOps cloud operations. This brings AI and advanced automation for DevOps practices
        and cloud native environments to achieve continuous software delivery pipelines and
        automated operations. I help IT organizations leverage the Autonomous Cloud Enablement
        (ACE) practice to create an autonomous cloud strategic vision, identify where to get
        started, provide hands-on expertise along the journey, and deliver rapid, meaningful
        automation services engagements to deliver unbreakable delivery pipelines and NoOps
        cloud operations.

    - role: Cloud Solutions Architect
      time: Mar 2015 - Apr 2019
      company: RightBrain Networks - Ann Arbor, MI
      details: |
        I was often the first technical resource made available to a new or potential client,
        and, as a result, I would interface with people at all levels of an organization –
        executives, project managers, developers & engineers – and speak to both the
        business objectives & the more technical issues and goals. As the subject matter
        expert, I examined a client’s criteria, designed the appropriate enterprise-level solution,
        and then led a small, dedicated team in implementation.

    - role: Storage Technician, Message Archiver & Backup Service
      time: May 2013 - Mar 2015
      company: Barracuda Networks - Ann Arbor, MI
      details: |
        I was the first-line technical resource for customers who require assistance. This
        meant managing multiple cases in different stages of progress, ranging from initial
        installations & simple configuration tasks to multi-platform deployments & device-to-
        device data migrations. All assistance was rendered remotely via SSH and remote
        sessions and would often include interfacing with multiple team members.
